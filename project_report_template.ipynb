    "## 1. Introduction ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Here in America, commentators have long noted the structural factors creating permanent communities of underprivileged citizens. In recent years, we’ve seen a particular focus on lack of access to critical health care and prevention resources, with legislative actions and nonprofit initiatives ranging from the Affordable Care Act to Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! campaign to reduce childhood obesity. One emerging area of investigation revolves around communities’ access to a variety high-quality, healthy foods. In our project, we aim to quantify these access issues by consider the optimal diets that can be constructed from the selection available at a variety of local different stores. \n",
    "\n",
    "In constructing our project, we realized that access to healthy nutritional foods depends on a variety of issues. How far away is the grocery store from your house? Do you even have a way of getting to the nearest grocery store? How can you construct a varied diet from the food available to you? Is it better to shop at more than one store given the variation in cost between stores? We sought to answer these questions by improving on a well-known study from economic literature: the Stigler diet.\n",
    "\n",
    "George Stigler was an economist at Columbia University and the University of Chicago who revolutionized his field by quantitatively analyzing the impact of government economic regulations (previous economists’ analysis had focused on qualitative effects and theory). [1] In 1945, Stigler gathered data on a basic list of foods, nutrients, and prices, then played with the numbers to quantify the cheapest possible diet on the market. His work would inspire George Dantzig to develop the Simplex Algorithm just a few years later, one of the most efficient algorithms available today for solving general problems with linear constraint and objective functions. [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Stigler’s diet provided a very good baseline for understanding the price associated with a barebones minimalist diet. However, he didn’t take into account that food has to be bought in unit quantities (he considered only how many nutrients were contained in one dollar’s worth of flour, for instance) and he didn’t consider several additional constraints, like travel time and expense, differing food price/availability by store, and age and gender concerns. In our project, we sought to address both of these issues to provide a more complete picture of modern Americans’ access to good, nutritious food.\n",
    "\n",
    "We got our nutrient data from the USDA’s Food Composition databases, available online. [3] We hypothesized different prices for different stores that varied based on season; we also created some estimate figures for gas prices and the like. In this report, we explain the theory behind the model in the Mathematical Model section and give the code we used in the code section. We discuss the key results immediately afterwards and provide some conclusions and directions for future study in the final section. We hope that this project will provide you the reader with a quantitative understanding of the tradeoffs between the best prices available and the time needed to travel to the stores that carry those best prices.\n",

    "## General Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Food prices are stable throughout the year and are not affected by seasonal variation and availability.\n",
    "- Stores have unlimited stock of food\n",
    "- Food must be purchased in whole number quantities (i. e., it is not possible to purchase 1.266 cans of green beans).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data used for our models\n",
    "Most of the data ensuring that the diet was interesting to eat, as well as all of the price data, was contrived for analysis. We based the nutritional data off the USDA's nutrient database (found at https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list), but some of the parameters were adjusted for model reasons.\n",

    "In the first scenario, our results were pretty similiar in concept to the results from Stigler's diet, which makes sense--we implemented something very similar to his work, except we used a mixed-integer program approach rather than his linear program approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "How did the second scenario change things? (note that meat constraint needed to be removed)\n",
    "\n",
    "Going into the third part (traveling salesman part) we found that there were too many data points (give numbers on this) to run on our current spreadsheet, which makes sense because... Therefore, we used our own contrived test data. We came up with the following Pareto curve tradeoffs for each scenario.\n",

    "Eventually we added deliciousness and came up with the following 3D graph. To use, please run the code and enter a number (like 30, the default) at the prompt. The graph will display at the observation angle described by your input. (We were not able to implement a click-and-drag graph, akin to those displayed on websites such as Wolfram Mathematica; improving 3D graphics in the Julia programming language is an interesting avenue of further exploration.)\n",

    "At first our optimal diets recommended a lot of beer for children and a non-negligible amount of infant formula for adults. Since these foods are clearly not age-appropriate, we added constraints limiting alcohol content and requiring that adults not cosume baby food. We also incorporated other logical constraints... In attempting to impose variety on the diets, we noticed that if the upper limits on fruit are too low, an appropriate diet becomes infeasible. Since many disadvantaged areas in America (and other parts of the world) have limited access to fresh, good-quality food, it's possible (indeed probable) that health disparities are enforced by the existence of the aforementioned food deserts.\n",
